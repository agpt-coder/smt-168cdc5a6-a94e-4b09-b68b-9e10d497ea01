Small-Scale Sawmill Software Features:  1. Price Estimator:    - Input fields for lumber dimensions, grade, and quantity    - Automatic price calculation based on predefined rates    - Generate and display customer quotes  2. Cutting List Optimizer:    - Input fields for customer requirements (dimensions, quantities)    - Optimize cutting patterns to minimize waste and maximize yield    - Generate and display optimized cutting instructions for operators  3. Inventory Tracking:    - Track raw materials (logs) and finished products (lumber)    - Monitor and display stock levels  4. Production Recording:    - Record and store daily production quantities    - Track and store lumber dimensions and grades  5. Sales and Invoicing:    - Manage customer contacts    - Generate and store quotes and invoices  6. Basic Reporting:    - Generate and display production reports (volume, yield)    - Generate and display sales reports (revenue)  7. Maintenance Logging:    - Record and store equipment maintenance data    - Generate and display maintenance schedule reminders  8. User-Friendly Interface:    - Intuitive and easy-to-use user interface    - Minimal training required for operators  9. Data Backup and Recovery:    - Automatic data backup to prevent loss    - Simple data recovery process  Please develop a software solution that incorporates these features, focusing on simplicity, user-friendliness, and efficiency for small-scale sawmill operations. The Price Estimator and Cutting List Optimizer should be the primary quality-of-life features, while the remaining features address essential sawmill management needs. The software should be affordable, easy to implement, and require minimal technical expertise to use and maintain.

## What you'll need to run this
* An unzipper (usually shipped with your OS)
* A text editor
* A terminal
* Docker
  > Docker is only needed to run a Postgres database. If you want to connect to your own
  > Postgres instance, you may not have to follow the steps below to the letter.


## How to run 'smt-1'

1. Unpack the ZIP file containing this package

2. Adjust the values in `.env` as you see fit.

3. Open a terminal in the folder containing this README and run the following commands:

    1. `poetry install` - install dependencies for the app

    2. `docker-compose up -d` - start the postgres database

    3. `prisma generate` - generate the database client for the app

    4. `prisma db push` - set up the database schema, creating the necessary tables etc.

4. Run `uvicorn project.server:app --reload` to start the app

## How to deploy on your own GCP account
1. Set up a GCP account
2. Create secrets: GCP_EMAIL (service account email), GCP_CREDENTIALS (service account key), GCP_PROJECT, GCP_APPLICATION (app name)
3. Ensure service account has following permissions: 
    Cloud Build Editor
    Cloud Build Service Account
    Cloud Run Developer
    Service Account User
    Service Usage Consumer
    Storage Object Viewer
4. Remove on: workflow, uncomment on: push (lines 2-6)
5. Push to master branch to trigger workflow
